        <h2>Some of my interests include...</h2>
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>I am excited for a career in business design, but if one were to ask me my "dream job" since I was very young that career has always been a writer. In a sense, it is like a designer except instead of graphics and animations, writers use words to form beautiful stories. I have not forgotten my dream, and still write occasionally. From high school newspaper editor-in-chief and state finalist in speech & debate to writing professional blogs for my previous company on the side of my consulting work to now writing newsletters for my classsmates...I always find my way back to the written word. From time to time, I write my musings and adventures on <a href="https://constellationcontemplation.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.

          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>Naturally after sharing my love of writing, how could I not share my love of reading? Books are the ultimate, timeless vehicle for learning and exploring. I personally am a big fan of fictional works, as books tell me a story but allow me to visualize and imagine the scenery and characters (nothing against movies, they just constrain the imagintion a bit). Prior to school I was a more voracious reader and intend to pick the habit back up over the summer. If you, too, are a book-lover, let's follow each other on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36382896-olivia-gordon"/>GoodReads</a>!

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>While I am definitely no professional, I do enjoy the joy and friendship that emerges with music and song. More recently, I am a more of a music-listern (check out a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/00rlMDnF3XikZsZRegsvfe?si=TyZxn_vGSU6PCfDTjDuEgg/">playlist</a>. I made last year, many Stevie Nicks songs!). But, I did use to sing quite a bit as well - check out some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stormea/sets/liv-storm"/>covers</a> my friend Storm and me performed :)</p>
